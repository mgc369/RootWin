One day I decided to create a reference book for schoolchildren dedicated to algebra and physics. If students do not understand what is written in the school textbook, they can look for some topics in this guide. It is incomplete because my goal is to improve the quality of my knowledge and skills in website development. And filling them with a lot of content in the form of a lot of text, formulas and tables is more mechanical than creative work. Thus, this site, like my other projects, does not claim anything. Any publication of my work on github is intended primarily for my development and evaluation of their quality from the point of view of a programmer.
